# My Very First Web Page

This is the first project that i have created on my Full Stack Developer course with [the Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
___

As part of the second module i created this web page following the video tutorial to create the first page index.html, then finished remaining two pages by myself.

The languages used are 

1. HTML5
2. CSS3

I have also learned how to use the terminal to create a local git repository add, commit and push into the repository and then push to GitHub.

I am only 3 days into the course but i am looking forward to the next few month of learning.
